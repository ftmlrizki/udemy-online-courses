# Discover The Most Popular Courses on Udemy

Welcome to my first published EDA project!

In this project, I will try to explore Udemy's online course data to gain insights about the popularity of its courses on the platform. This analysis was carried out to see how we could increase revenue for the company. Do all categories perform equally well? If not, which categories require more attention? There appear to be more than ten categories available on Udemy. However, in this project, we would limit our analysis to four categories. The whole process can be read in the 'Discover The Most Popular Courses on Udemy.ipynb' notebook. And the dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/udemy-courses

We can assist the marketing team in determining what strategies they need to increase more profits by analyzing the dataset more thoroughly and giving recommendations based on our findings.
